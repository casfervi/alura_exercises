There are few files html with just lines write on them. It was used to exercises. 

There are two games, a number and a word guess. Both programs are in PT-BR. A third file, called jogos.py, can call both games and you can choose between them after run that. You can also run the games individually. To run the program, you should import the random library. It should be made with the import at the beginning of the program
