## Games on Python

There are two games, a number and a word guess. Both programs are in PT-BR. A third file, called jogos.py, can call both games and you can choose between them after run that. You can also run the games individually. To run the program, you should import the random library. It should be made with the import at the beginning of the program
```
import random
```
I hope you have fun!

## Airflow 

The file called *dados_climaticos.py* presents a pipeline from a website, *https://www.visualcrossing.com/*. This file needs a key, a URL and it is programmed to collect data from the weather every week and put this weekly data in a specific file. The city is "Boston", but it can be changed as you wish.

If you use this file, please be sure to change the path of the folder of your computer in the file as well as the personal key to collect the data. Also, don't forget to install the packages needed to run this, such as Pandas and Airflow.

I hope it can be useful for you.
